I am a PhD student under [Steven Ramsay](https://sjrsay.github.io) at the School of Computer Science, University of Bristol. Before this, I completed my undergraduate degree (MEng in Computer Science and Mathematics), also, at Bristol. My interests include: functional programming, static analysis, type systems and other formal methods, and the previous in object orientated programming.

Research
======

I have previously worked on a type system for functional languages that can prove both correctness and incorrectness results of programs. This was done via a sequent calculus where the atomic formulae are program typings. [[λ](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06928)]

I am currently working on a type refinement system for OO programming languages (specifically c#) that gives stronger guarantees on functional style code. More specifically, I am working on solving pattern match safety in modern OO languages that allow for conditionals on runtime types. This work uses
[Intensional Refinement Types](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2008.01452) as a basis.

Papers, etc.
